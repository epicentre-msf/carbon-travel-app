# Carbon Travel App

# Purpose

This is a multi-function app that help users look into the Carbon emissions due to travel for MSF/Epicentre

The app is organised in two parts

1. **The travel planner**
   helps MSF/EPICENTRE decision makers to identify suitable meeting/events locations in order to minimise the *plane travel* CO2 emissions.

  **Note:** this algorithms uses straight line travel between cities and does not take into account possible stop overs

2. **The Amex Analysis**
   This tab provides a *preliminary* analysis into the AMEX data. This dataset summarises all the air travels booked through the AMEX travel agency

# Roadmap
- [ ] Estimate emission for one travel (tomorrow I go to Geneva - what are my emissions ?)
- [ ] Extent to include train data for European destination
